## Conversion Factors

Meter to feet: 1 m = 3.28084 ft
Meter to mile: 1 m = 0.000621371 mi
Meter to kilometer: 1 m = 0.001 km

## Speed vs Velocity

avg speed = distance traveled / elapsed time
avg velocity = displacement / elapsed time

The distance traveled by the tip of the blade is the circumference of the circle that the blade tip traces out.  The formula for the circumference of a circle is:
C = 2 *pi* r where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is 5.5 meters.

The elapsed time is the time it takes for the blade to make one revolution.  The blade makes 115 revolutions per minute.  To convert this to seconds, we use the conversion factor of 60 seconds per minute.

# SLR Assumptions

## Simple linear regression assumptions

The simple linear regression model assumes that at each value of the predictor, X, the probability distribution of the regression error.

- has a mean of zero,
- has constant variance, and
- is normal.

At each value of x in the figure below, the density curve shows the probability distribution of the regression error to be:

- centered on the regression line (where the error is zero),
- equally wide (equally variance), and
- bell-shaped and symmetric (normal).

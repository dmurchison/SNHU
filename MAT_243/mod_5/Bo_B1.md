# Obtaining Bo and B1

Bo and B1 are the coefficients of the linear regression model.

- Bo  represents the **estimated simple linear regression Y-intercept**, which is the fitted value of Y when X=0.
- B1  represents the **estimated simple linear regression slope**, which is the change in the predicted value of Y for a one-unit change in X.

# Regression Lines

## Least Squares Method

To create a graph using two arrays in python, one as the X and one as the Y, we can use the following code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```
